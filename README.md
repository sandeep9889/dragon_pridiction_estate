here we as employ we have to increase the performance as company by  predict correct price of home where 13 features are given and 1 as label.
features are --
 1. CRIM      per capita crime rate by town
    2. ZN        proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 
                 25,000 sq.ft.
    3. INDUS     proportion of non-retail business acres per town
    4. CHAS      Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds 
                 river; 0 otherwise)
    5. NOX       nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
    6. RM        average number of rooms per dwelling
    7. AGE       proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
    8. DIS       weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
    9. RAD       index of accessibility to radial highways
    10. TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
    11. PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
    12. B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks 
                 by town
    13. LSTAT    % lower status of the population
    
    
label  is--
 14. MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
 
 
so he we have to predict a data of house so we use regresion 
    -- we have mainly three regression 
         1> linear regression
         2> decision tree regression
         3> random forest regression
         
         
      firstly i  use all three regression 
         but after some try i notice in three of them one random forest regression do better work 
           it work good because its show less error 
           and show good prediction 
         ----- i build a model a name as  dragon.joblib
         
         
------- go open the file in jupyter or google colab notebook dragon_pridictor.ipynb
